# Zero

Because we're all perverts on the inside (and outside) ! Use 'Zero' to have a simple yet quite elegant style for Danbooru.

What's an userstyle ?
-------------------------------

Simply put, it's a script with a bunch of pseudo-code that will change the aspect of any website, it's kind like make-up I guess : you'll be able to change/modify the visual of the elements of the page (background, icon, buttons, etc...) and even delete some useless stuff. To use it, there is an add-on called 'Stylish' for the majority of the browser, so if you are on Chrome, Firefox, Opera and such go for it ! I also recommend you to go to userstyles.org (userstyles.org/) where you can found a lot of styles for a lot of website.

What do 'Zero' change ?
-------------------------------

I use a lot of time Danbooru (especially for lewd stuff), that's why I decided to write a script for it (because it's quite ugly to be honest!).
Added a header becasuse why the fuck not, it's cool as fuck, with this some japanese characters for the aesthetic (the buttons such as Artist/Wiki/Post can be found in the top right corner, you'll get used to it I promise), changed the font, the colors, and hide the menu bar (the one with favorite/forum/posts/etc), you'll have to hover he hamburger icon to activate it ! 

How to install it ?
-------------------------------

After installing 'Stylish', you'll have to 'write a new style', copy/paste the code in 'zero.css', name the style and then save ! Before installing it, I suggest you :

* to install the font I used, namely 'Roboto' (www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/roboto), 'Bebas Neue' (www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/bebas-neue), 'Bokutachi no Gothic 2' (http://www.freejapanesefont.com/bokutachi-gothic-2-bold/) and if you want Meiryo, all of them are free so don't be shy.
* download Adblock Plus to kill the ads.
* install GreaseMonkey (for Mozilla) or TamperMonkey (for Google).
* install this script to load all the pages in danbooru (ie infinite scrolling) : https://sleazyfork.org/en/scripts/5250-unlimited-paginator-works/code

Where can I find your works ?
-------------------------------

I have a deviantart page : nicknameisfortheweak.deviantart.com, I also submit my script in pastebin : http://pastebin.com/u/Catgrills

And that's it, I hope you'll enjoy this script if you see this submission ! Like usual, if you find the script cool or bad, if you have questions, suggestions, there is a section called 'Comments', you can use it everytime !
